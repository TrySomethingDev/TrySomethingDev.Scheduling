# TrySomethingDev.Scheduling

This repo will be the beginning of a Job Shop Scheduling System, and perhaps some other kind of Scheduling Challenges.
Goal is to make a accurate and easy to use scheduling system, that can be integrated with other system, to make easy to create  
maintain a schedule. While also doing some really cool event based simulation.
